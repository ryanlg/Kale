# Kale
~~A certain cultivars of cabbage, grown for their edible leaves.~~

A complier of **Kale**idocope based on the very very terribly written [LLVM tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html).

This serves as a project to both learn how to do compiler design, and also remind myself how to write C++, which is a pain in my bum bum.

##### Fun fact 
Usually in China, kales are used as (very ugly) decorations on the sides of the roads, but apparently in other countries people eat them.~~
